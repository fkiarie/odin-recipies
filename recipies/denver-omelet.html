    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The Denver omelet is a change of pace from a French omelet and is known for its firmer 
        texture and caramelized flavor. It's one of the first foods I learned to 
        cook professionally as a line cook in high school. Make it a 
        complete lunch or dinner with arugula salad and toasted bread.</p>
    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Three large eggs</li>
        <li>One tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup diced smoked ham</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons diced onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons diced green bell pepper</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>⅓ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Beat eggs in a small bowl until just combined; do not overbeat.</li>
        <li>Step 2: Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add ham, onion, and bell pepper;
            season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until onions soften and ham begins to caramelize, 
            about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Step 3: 
            Reduce heat to medium-low and pour in eggs. Mix briefly with a spatula while shaking the pan to
             ensure ingredients are evenly distributed.Quickly run the spatula along edges of omelet.
             Sprinkle Cheddar cheese and cayenne pepper over omelet.
        </li>
        <li>
            step 4: 
            Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until top is still wet but not runny,
            about 5 minutes. Use a spatula to fold omelet in half and transfer it to a plate.
        </li>
    </ol>
